## Description

With @sapphire/phisherman, you can have an out of the box integration with [Phisherman](https://phisherman.gg).

## Features

-   Easy to use

## Before we start
* What is phisherman?
Phisherman is a centralised database of phishing and scam links. It is designed for use with Discord bots, allowing them to utilise the Phisherman API to cross-check urls against our known phishing links.

Note: Phisherman is currently in early access. For more information or to request access, please visit their [discord server](https://discord.gg/QwrpmTgvWy).

## Installation

You can use the following command to install this package, or replace `npm install` with your package manager of choice.

```sh
npm install @sapphire/phisherman
```

---

## Usage

**Note:** While this section uses `import`, it maps 1:1 with CommonJS' require syntax. For example, `import { check } from '@sapphire/phisherman'` is the same as `const { checkDomain } = require('@sapphire/phisherman')`.

Before you do anything make sure to set the apiKey like this:
```typescript
import { setApiKey } from '@sapphire/phisherman';

setApiKey('your-api-key');
```

The main use you will have for phisherman is checking whether an URL is safe or not. You can do so with:

```typescript
import { checkDomain } from '@sapphire/phisherman';

checkDomain('some-domain');
```

If you have an URL that didn't pass the check, but you are sure is actually a phishing site, you can use the following to report it to phisherman:

```typescript
import { reportDomain } from '@sapphire/phisherman';

reportDomain('some-domain');
```
