## Description

There is often a need to have async iterators with fine control, timeouts, limits, filter, and so on, this package exists to satisfy those needs. By implementing an [async iterator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol/asyncIterator) which can be used with [`for await...of`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of) loops.

## Features

-   Written in TypeScript
-   Bundled with esbuild so it can be used in NodeJS and browsers
-   Offers CommonJS, ESM and UMD bundles
-   Fully tested

## Installation

You can use the following command to install this package, or replace `npm install` with your package manager of choice.

```sh
npm install @sapphire/event-iterator
```

## Usage

**Note:** While this section uses `require`, the imports match 1:1 with ESM imports. For example `const { EventIterator } = require('@sapphire/event-iterator')` equals `import { EventIterator } from '@sapphire/event-iterator'`.

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// Import the EventIterator class
const { EventIterator } = require('@sapphire/event-iterator');

// Define an event iterator with a limit of 2 entries
const iterator = new EventIterator(emitter, 'message', { limit: 2 });

emitter.emit('message', { id: 'foo' });
emitter.emit('message', { id: 'bar' });
emitter.emit('message', { id: 'baz' });

for await (const message of iterator) {
	console.log(message);
	// Logs: { id: 'foo' }
	// Logs: { id: 'bar' }
}

// The iterator ended at second item, { id: 'baz' } is not collected due to the specified limit.
```
